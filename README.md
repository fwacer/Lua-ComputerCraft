# Lua-ComputerCraft-turtleControl
This code is for a GUI-based remote turtle control system in Lua using the ComputerCraft mod for Minecraft
If you use this and show others, please credit it to me.

Instructions:

1: Open your home turtles's directory. (The one that will be controlling this all)
	Ex: .minecraft/saves/YourWorldName/computer/1
2: Copy the contents of the folder "Home Computer Files" (from the the zip that this readme file is from) to the home turtle's directory.
	Hint: If you don't know your computer's ID, type "lua" in the computer's interface, then type "os.getComputerId()". It will return the computer's id number.
3: Name each of your turtles the names shown in this video: http://youtu.be/jUETzHSD6yc
	(Or change the names in the array in the file "Home Computer Files/turtleGui/d"
4: Copy the startup file from "Turtle's files" to the directory of each of these turtles.

5: Ensure the home computer has a wireless modem on the LEFT side, and all turtles have a wireless modem on their left side.
	(Note: You must have a working GPS set up in your world. Information on GPSs: http://www.computercraft.info/forums2/index.php?/topic/3088-how-to-guide-gps-global-position-system/
6: Make sure the home computer has a 5x5 grid of advanced monitors above it.

That should be all!
